# Basic Network Sniffer

## Overview
This project is a simple **network sniffer** built in Python. It captures and analyzes packets flowing through a network interface, helping users understand the fundamentals of network traffic analysis.

## Features
- Captures network packets using raw sockets.
- Displays packet details such as source/destination IP, protocol, and port numbers.
- Written in Python for simplicity and ease of use.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Requires **root/admin privileges** to run, due to the use of raw sockets.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-network-sniffer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd basic-network-sniffer
   ```
3. **Run the Sniffer**:
   ```sh
   sudo python3 sniffer.py
   ```

## Disclaimer
This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use may be illegal. Please ensure you have permission before sniffing network traffic.
