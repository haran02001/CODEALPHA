# Basic Network Sniffer

## Overview
This project is a simple **network sniffer** built in Python. It captures and analyzes packets flowing through a network interface, helping users understand the fundamentals of network traffic analysis.

## Features
- Captures network packets using raw sockets.
- Displays packet details such as source/destination IP, protocol, and port numbers.
- Written in Python for simplicity and ease of use.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Requires **root/admin privileges** to run, due to the use of raw sockets.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-network-sniffer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd basic-network-sniffer
   ```
3. **Run the Sniffer**:
   ```sh
   sudo python3 sniffer.py
   ```

## Disclaimer
This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use may be illegal. Please ensure you have permission before sniffing network traffic.

# Phishing Awareness Training

## Overview
This project is an educational module focused on **Phishing Awareness**. It aims to help users identify, understand, and avoid phishing attacks through a combination of a presentation, an online training module, and interactive quizzes. It provides detailed information on recognizing phishing emails, suspicious websites, and social engineering tactics, as well as tips for maintaining cybersecurity.

## Project Structure
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including a detailed training outline, glossary of important cybersecurity terms, and additional resources.
- **presentation/**: A PowerPoint presentation (`.pptx`) and a PDF version providing a visual walkthrough of phishing tactics, examples, and best practices.
- **online-module/**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for an interactive online training module. This includes training videos, interactive lessons, and quizzes.
- **quizzes/**: A set of quizzes to test users on their phishing knowledge, including questions and answers.
- **scripts/**: Instructions for setting up the training module locally, with a list of dependencies and other requirements.

## Features
- **Phishing Awareness Presentation**: A visual guide with real-life examples of phishing attacks, explaining how to spot red flags in emails and links.
- **Interactive Online Module**: An HTML-based training with multimedia support that guides users through common phishing scenarios.
- **Quizzes and Assessments**: Interactive quizzes to evaluate participants' understanding of phishing techniques and safety measures.
- **Glossary and Resources**: A glossary of key cybersecurity terms and a list of additional resources for deeper learning.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- HTML and CSS knowledge for minor changes.
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the online module.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-awareness-training.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd phishing-awareness-training
   ```
3. **Launch the Online Module**:
   Open `online-module/index.html` in your web browser.

### Running the Training Locally
1. Follow the instructions in `scripts/setup_instructions.md` to set up the local environment.
2. Ensure all necessary media files and scripts are accessible.

## Usage
- Use the **presentation** as a teaching aid for workshops or seminars.
- The **online module** can be hosted on a learning management system (LMS) or used as a standalone web-based training tool.
- **Quizzes** are designed to be taken after completing the module, providing valuable feedback and understanding of the topic.
